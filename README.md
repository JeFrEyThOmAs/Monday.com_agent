## 📖 Overview

Monday Intelligence AI is an AI-powered assistant that allows users to interact with their Monday.com workspace using natural language instead of manually searching through boards.

Rather than navigating multiple dashboards, filtering data manually, or writing GraphQL queries, users can simply ask questions like:

- "Show open deals"
- "Find high priority tasks"
- "Show deals owned by OWNER_004"
- "List Mining sector deals"

The assistant automatically determines which tool to use, fetches live data from Monday.com, and returns an easy-to-read response.

# ✨ Features

---

## 📈 Deal Funnel Intelligence

## 🤖 AI Agent

The project uses **LangChain's tool-calling agent**.

Instead of hardcoding logic, the LLM decides which tool should be executed based on the user's request.

Example:

```
User:
Show open Mining deals

↓

Gemini understands the intent

↓

Selects the appropriate tool

↓

Queries Monday GraphQL API

↓

Returns formatted results
```

This makes the assistant easily extensible for additional boards and tools.

# 💡 Why This Project?

Traditional project management tools require users to manually search, filter, and navigate between multiple boards.

Monday Intelligence AI introduces a conversational interface where users interact with enterprise data using natural language, reducing friction and improving accessibility.

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing new boards, tools, and workflows to be added with minimal changes.
